This JavaScript code implements a number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, which the user must guess. The user is repeatedly prompted to enter a guess until they correctly guess the number.

The code starts by defining the minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) numbers for the guessing range. It then generates a random number (`answer`) within this range. The variable `attempts` keeps track of the number of guesses made, while `running` controls the game's loop.

In the `while` loop, the user is prompted to enter a guess. The input is converted to a number using `Number(guess)`. If the input is not a valid number (`isNaN(guess)`) or is outside the specified range (`guess < min || guess > max`), an alert is shown asking for a valid number.

If the guess is valid, the number of attempts is incremented. Depending on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct, different alerts are shown. If the guess matches the `answer`, an alert displays the number of attempts taken, and the loop ends by setting `running` to `false`.

This straightforward structure ensures that the user is guided to provide valid input and receive feedback until they successfully guess the number.
